## 🚀 Overview

AI Interviewer Pro transforms interview preparation by analyzing your resume and generating **adaptive, personalized technical questions** powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash AI. Whether you're a student preparing for campus placements or a fresher targeting tech companies, this platform provides real-time voice interviews, instant feedback, and targeted learning paths to improve your weak areas.

### 💡 Why I Built This

As a AI & Data Science student at MBM Jodhpur, I experienced firsthand the challenges of technical interview preparation—generic question banks, no adaptive difficulty, and zero personalized feedback. After competing in Smart India Hackathon finals, I realized AI could solve this problem. AI Interviewer Pro is the tool I wish I had when starting my interview prep journey.

## 🧪 Technical Highlights

### Gemini Prompt Engineering

The quality of AI responses depends on prompt design. Here's how I structured them:

**Resume Analysis Prompt:**
```typescript
const analysisPrompt = `Analyze this resume and extract ONLY JSON:
{
  "experience_level": "0-1 years" | "1-2 years" | "2+ years",
  "primary_skills": ["skill1", "skill2", ...], // max 5
  "weak_areas_detected": ["area1", "area2", ...] // max 3
}

Resume text:
${resumeText}

Rules:
- Be conservative with experience estimation
- Focus on technical skills only
- Weak areas = mentioned but not demonstrated
- No markdown, just raw JSON`;
```

**Adaptive Question Generation:**
```typescript
const adaptivePrompt = `Previous answer score: ${score}/10
Detected weakness: ${weakArea}

Generate a ${difficulty} level question targeting this gap.

Required JSON format:
{
  "question": "Clear problem statement",
  "difficulty": "Easy" | "Medium" | "Hard",
  "topic": "Main category",
  "subtopic": "Specific area",
  "time_limit_minutes": 15-45,
  "expected_approach": "High-level solution strategy",
  "key_concepts": ["concept1", "concept2"],
  "hints": ["hint1", "hint2", "hint3"],
  "follow_up": "Optional deeper question"
}`;
```

### Performance Metrics

- ⚡ **Resume Analysis**: < 3 seconds (with Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- 🎯 **Question Generation**: < 2 seconds per question
- 🎙️ **Voice Response Latency**: < 1 second (WebRTC)
- 📦 **Production Bundle**: ~450KB gzipped
- 🚀 **Lighthouse Score**: 95+ (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices)
